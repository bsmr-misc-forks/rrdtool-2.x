RRDtool 2.x - Re-Engineering RRDtool for the next 15 Years

=head1 CONTEXT

Since its initial release in 1999, RRDtool has become an integral part of
many monitoring applications. Its applications have spread far and wide. Way
beyond the initial vision. RRDtool is used everywhere: in tiny embedded systems as well as
in huge enterprise monitoring systems with hundreds of thousands of data
sources.

My main concerns when designing applications is to come up with simple and
logical interfaces, covering all the necessary functionality and providing a
path for further enhancement. This has worked very well with RRDtool 1.x,
but there are some central design elements that are not so easily
changed and are therefore blocking incremental development.

=head1 VISION

Part of the success of RRDtool is based on the fact that a single package
takes care of all your time series data storage, retrieval and presentation
needs. Any future version of RRDtool will do the same, only more so.

A prime objective of the 2.x rewrite is to create clear internal APIs for the
interaction of the individual components of RRDtool. This will make it
possible to replace or drastically modify one component without changes to
the rest of the system. To some extent, this pattern was already present in
RRDtool 1.x, but especially in the data storage layer the structure does not
lend itself to extensions all that well.

=head1 DEVELOPMENT PLAN

Rewriting RRDtool is a major software engineering effort. Here is the plan to achieve it.

=over

=item 1.

Collect requirements, using the GitHub Issue Tracker

=item 2.

Triage requirements

=item 3.

Create and document a coherent, modular design, down to the internal API
level.

=item 4.

Plan and budget the implementation.

=item 5.

Launch a Crowd-Funding project to raise the money for the implementation.

=item 6.

Implement.

=item 7.

Release 2.0

=back

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

=over

=item Test Suite

All 2.x functionality is exercised by a test suite.

=item Backward Compatibility

The 2.x design addresses all the complex issued not easily changed by
altering RRDtool 1.x. Most of the 1.x functionality is present in RRDtool
2.x. An 1.x compatibility API emulates the 1.x behavior on top of the 2.x
API.

=head1 FREE SOFTWARE LICENSE

A suitable Free Software License for RRDtool 2.x is to be determined based
on feedback from the people financing the development. It could be GNU GPL
V2, V3, GNU LGPL

=head1 NOTE

This document will evolve as the project takes shape.
